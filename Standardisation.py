Pandas DataFrame stores data in tabular form,  while .values extracts onlythe raw numerical values as a NumPy array.
Efficient Computations – NumPy operations are faster and consume less memory compared to Pandas operations. 
Required by Some ML Libraries – Many machine learning libraries (like Scikit-Learn) expect input in the form of a NumPy array instead of a Pandas DataFrame.
