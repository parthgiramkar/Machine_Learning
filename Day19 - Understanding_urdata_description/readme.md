df.corr(numeric_only=True) 
A correlation matrix is a table that shows the correlation coefficients between many variables at once. Each cell in the table shows how strongly two variables are related

Strength: The closer the number is to 1 or -1, the stronger the relationship. A value of 0.8 is a strong positive relationship, while -0.2 is a weak negative one.

Diagonal: The diagonal of the matrix, from the top-left to the bottom-right, always has values of 1, because a variable is perfectly correlated with itself.

Symmetry: The matrix is symmetrical. The correlation between Variable A and Variable B is the same as the correlation between Variable B and Variable A.
