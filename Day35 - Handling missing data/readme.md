Complete Case Analysis (CCA)  is a method which is used to handle missing data - 
It's used to remove all rows from the dataset that contain any missing (NaN) values

only when the missing data is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) and when % of missing values are < 5 % and >0 %
also not used in production , as the model is not trained to handle missing values
