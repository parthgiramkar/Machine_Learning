Handling Missing Data by using mean and median imputation  : - 
Use when  data is missing completely at random(MCAR) and when %of missing is <5%

Handling Missing Data by arbitary value imputation : - 
replaces the missing data by any arbitary value like -1 , 999 like anything

The main purpose of this method is to flag the missing values so that a machine learning model can treat them differently.
When to Use It: This method is often used with tree-based models (like Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost).
