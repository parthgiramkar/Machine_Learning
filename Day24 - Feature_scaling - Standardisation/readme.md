                                                        UNDER Feature Engginering

Under Feature Scaling - which is used to standardise data of indep features(x) into fixed_range

comes the Standardisation aslo called z-score_normalisation , apply it when u are using - Data is normally distributed ,
u are using ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN ,ANN , PCA ,gradient descent . 

Formula - 
z= (x−μ)/σ , So values typically fall between -3 and +3
