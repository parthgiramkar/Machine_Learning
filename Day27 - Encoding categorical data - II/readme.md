When the categorical data is not ordered (without ranking) , i.e it is Nominal Data

Use ONEHOTENCODING(OHE) , converts categorical data (nominal) into binary columns one for each category , same as the ordinal encoder does it for the ordinal data

OneHotEncoding with and without the sklearn library Codes , more preferred_to use the sklearn one
