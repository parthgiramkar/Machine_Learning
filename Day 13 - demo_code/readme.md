Overfitting happens when a machine learning model : - 


Performs very well on training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.
in other words , the model memorizes the data instead of learning patterns.

To avoid overfitting, always :-
Split your dataset into: Training set (for learning) and  Validation/test set (for checking performance)
